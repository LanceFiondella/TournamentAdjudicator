</br>	Team Roles:

</br>	In order to run the program, we run it using visual studio which launches a web server at http://localhost:62027 
</br>	We use a chrome extension called postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) on chrome to input example data
</br>	The first message sent is a GET request for each of 4 users to http://localhost:62027/api/user
</br>	The user should save their ID and Hash.
</br>	To get the board state or send a move, send a POST request to http://localhost:62027/api/game/IDNumber where IDNumber is the ID number taht was saved earlier. in the header should include the Hash connected to the ID number.  
</br> To update the board state include the updated game board of your new move


</br></br> Troubleshooting:
</br> If you cant get visual studio to launch the program in a browser: Close and reopen visual studio(possibly multiple time).
</br> If you cant get the game going as a single person: Currently all games must have 4 players and this will be updated in the future.
